            There are a number of ways to secure a website from web security attacks. Some of these ways are to make sure that:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure that all data is sanitized before it is accepted by the system, either manually or through trusted third-party solutions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that the website uses a secure authentication and open-standard authorization protocol or framework.
                    Make use of well-known and trusted third-party applications, when possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that the website is built using a continuous integration/continuous deployment workflow. This can catch oversights made
                    by developers when changes occur in the codebase, and reject changes before reaching production.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that the network the website is hosted on is secure.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Automaticaly timeout inactive users to protect user credentials
                </li>
            </ul>  
        </p>
